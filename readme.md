## About
This is a simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the PHYLUCE pipeline that tries to mirror the Tutorial IV from the PHYLUCE Readthedocs : https://phyluce.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/tutorial-4.html

If you use this code you must also cite PHYLUCE and Stampy along with a few other helpers LASTAL 

The GUI will help students and users of all levels keep organized and make the bar to entry of doing phylogenomics less intimidating. There are also a few good things that I added such as accepting spaces in some (but not all ) file names (spaces in file names should be avoided) it also solve a memory bloom issue at the lastz alignment step by writing the sql database in a step-wise manner. Other than these small additions it is basically PHYLUCE wrapped in a GUI, that students can run on their laptops. It assumes you already have assembled genomes. OK have fun with it and I hope it helps to improve your phylogenomic workflow.
